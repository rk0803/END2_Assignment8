First two repositories ( i.e. 2 and 3)could be suucessfully refactored with new data processing pipeline.</br>
Repo 4 was tried. The last part where inference and bleu score is displayed that could not be completed by this time. However, the model could be successfully trained. That partial part is uploaded as **partof4.....ipynb** notebook. </br>
**code_4Packed Padded Sequences, Masking, Inference and BLEU** Now contains complete work of repo 4 refactored with new data pre-processing pipeline, with attention plotted and bleu_score calculated. However, here even though the sentences generated are same, bleu_score is coming out to be zero. Which needs to be further investigated.</br>
